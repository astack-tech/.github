AStack is a composable framework designed to simplify the development of AI applications through a "everything is a component" philosophy. It provides a zero-adaptation layer design that enables seamless integration between various AI models, tools, and custom business logic.

AStack is an independent technical framework with its own architecture and ecosystem, built on top of [Hlang](https://github.com/hlang-tech) - a highly semantic [fourth-generation language (4GL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth-generation_programming_language) inspired by Flow-Based Programming paradigms. This foundation on Hlang, which is particularly well-suited for computational modeling and AI-generated code, is what gives AStack its power. The framework emphasizes minimalism and performance, allowing developers to create complex systems with minimal boilerplate code while maintaining complete technical autonomy.
